# JavaLockpicking
A Text-Interactive Java Lockpicking Simulation

This is my Java 9 Text-Interactive Lockpicking Game.
Code is relatively cleaned, but I also wanted the processes to be logical and easily followable
My parsing technique uses nextLine and contains to find the applicable values from input
Any updates to pin types and event(action) types can be made to the enum in the respective interface class
If an event(action) is added, the function processEvent in core must be updated to support it
Enum for difficulty stored in Game.java
Basic instructions for play are presented when main is run.
